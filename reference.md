## Contributing Documentation

Please feel free to send us suggestions and modifications to this documentation! The content is hosted on [github](https://github.com/slaclab/sdf-docs) and as long as you have a github account, you can send us [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) where we can review your changes and merge them into this site.

?> __TIP__ At the top of each page, there is also a 'Edit Page' button that will send you directly to the page on github to be edited

The documentation uses [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/) to render [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) documents into a static website using only javascript. Whilst not necessary to submit changes, you may want to view the webpage locally for development purposes. Once you have cloned this document repository, you can start a local web server to preview all changes. Please see [here](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) for more details.
